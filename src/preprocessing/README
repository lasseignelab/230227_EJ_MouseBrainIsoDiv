Warning! This preprocessing step, by nature, is not fully reproducible. 
The assignment of novel transcript IDs by Bambu (run with the nf-core nanoseq 
pipeline) may result in different tx.***** IDs being created and assigned, so 
read counts for these transcripts may differ between runs. If you wish to 
reproduce this analysis exactly, please use the provided transcript counts 
files as a starting place, instead of the the preprocessing.
